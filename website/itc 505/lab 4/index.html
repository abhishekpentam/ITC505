      <p>
        We introduce the Elsevier OA CC-BY corpus. This is the first open corpus of scientific
        research papers which has a representative sample from across scientific disciplines.
        This corpus not only includes the full text of the article, but also the metadata of
        the documents, along with the bibliographic information for each reference.
      </p>

      <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        We are pleased to release the Elsevier OA CC-BY corpus for NLP and AI research. This is
        a corpus of 40,091 open access articles from across Elsevier’s journals representing a
        large scale, cross-discipline set of research data to support NLP and ML research.
        Research into the application of NLP and ML to scholarly content has attracted
        considerable attention in recent years. However, progress has been limited due to a lack
        of large, cross-discipline datasets. This dataset addresses that gap.

      <h2 id="rel">2. Related Work</h2>
      <p>
        Open source datasets of academic articles are not new, with notable corpora including
        PubMed OA, CiteSeerX, ACL Anthology, and arXiv. However, these often lack resolved
        metadata, making it difficult to establish citation connections. Projects such as
        Semantic Scholar’s Literature Graph and S2ORC have advanced this area by extracting
        references and building large-scale literature graphs.

    <article aria-labelledby="data">
      <h2 id="data">3. Dataset</h2>

      <h3 id="sample">3.1 Data Sampling</h3>
      <p>
        The corpus consists of articles published since 2014, covered by a CC-BY 4.0 licence.
        A stratified sampling method ensured equal representation from Elsevier’s subject
        classifications (ASJC codes). 2,000 documents were sampled from each of 27 top-level
        disciplines.
      </p>

      <h3 id="structure">3.2 Data Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Each article is contained within its own JSON file, with metadata (authors, title,
        publication info), abstract, body text split by sentences, and bibliographic references.
        The structure allows reconstruction of article hierarchy and linkage between references.
      </p>

      <h3 id="coverage">3.3 Data Coverage and Statistics</h3>
      <p>
        The dataset has nearly full coverage of metadata, abstracts, and references. Publication
        years range from 2014–2020, with over 40,000 documents across multiple disciplines
        including medicine, engineering, environmental science, computer science, and more.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article aria-labelledby="use">
      <h2 id="use">4. Use of Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset can be downloaded from
        <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zm33cdndxs/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mendeley Data</a>.
        It supports ML and NLP research across domains and can be used to build task-specific
        datasets for citation intent classification, entity extraction, and more.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article aria-labelledby="conc">
      <h2 id="conc">5. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        This dataset provides a large-scale, cross-discipline corpus that supports the
        development of ML and NLP models targeting scholarly text. It complements existing
        domain-specific corpora and enables validation across disciplines.

    <!-- Addendum required by Lab 4 -->
    <section aria-labelledby="addendum">
      <h2 id="addendum">Addendum: Rationale for Presentational Choices</h2>

      <h3>Typeface choices</h3>
      <p>
        I used a system-UI font stack to respect platform diversity and performance—no webfont
        download is required. This yields San Francisco on macOS/iOS, Segoe UI on Windows,
        Roboto/Inter on many Linux/Android builds, and falls back to generic <code>sans-serif</code>.
        For long-form reading, the stack renders crisply on laptop-density displays.
      </p>

      <h3>Heading hierarchy & text sizing</h3>
      <p>
        There is exactly one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> (the paper title). Section headings are
        <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and subsections <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>. Sizes use
        <code>clamp()</code> to scale modestly with viewport width while remaining comfortable
        on laptop screens: body at ~18px, <code>h2</code> roughly 28–32px, and
        <code>h3</code> ~22–24px. Line-height is set to 1.65 for readable academic paragraphs.
      </p>

      <h3>Color system</h3>
      <p>
        A neutral light theme (near-white background, graphite text) minimizes glare and
        emphasizes content. Accent hues are a desaturated blue for links and subtle dividers.
        I also honor user preferences with <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark</code> to invert
        tokens for comfortable evening reading on laptops.
      </p>

      <h3>Spacing (margins & padding)</h3>
      <p>
        Content width is limited to ~72ch to avoid long line length. A consistent spacing scale
        (4px baseline) provides ample white space between sections, lists, and headings. Lists
        use hanging markers and balanced indent. The page header and the addendum are visually
        separated with increased top/bottom rhythm and a rule.
      </p>

      <h3>Layout & affordances</h3>
      <p>
        The layout is single-column for focused reading on laptop screens. Links gain a clear
        focus ring and underline to meet accessibility expectations. Long reference items use
        comfortable list spacing and numeric alignment for easy citation scanning.
      </p>

      <h3>Modern CSS & platform respect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Custom properties (CSS variables) for color, type scale, and spacing.</li>
        <li><code>prefers-color-scheme</code> for light/dark without JS.</li>
        <li><code>clamp()</code> for fluid but bounded typography.</li>
        <li>High-contrast focus outlines; no reliance on color alone.</li>
        <li>Reduced-motion courtesy (no animation added for this reading context).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>HTML abuse</h3>
      <p>
        The Lab 2 source already used an appropriate semantic outline. For Lab 4, I:
        (a) kept a single <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the paper title,
        (b) standardized all major sections to <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and their parts to
        <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, and
        (c) wrapped the header metadata in a presentational byline rather than forcing a wrong
        heading level. No headings are chosen for style; all styling now lives in CSS.
