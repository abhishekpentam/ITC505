    <h1>Elsevier OA CC-BY Corpus</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      We introduce the Elsevier OA CC-BY corpus, the first open corpus of scientific
      research papers that includes full text and metadata from many fields.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Elsevier OA CC-BY corpus contains 40,091 open-access articles from
      Elsevier journals, supporting NLP and AI research. It provides a broad
      cross-discipline dataset for machine-learning studies.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Related Work</h2>
    <p>
      Other open datasets like PubMed OA, CiteSeerX, ACL Anthology, and arXiv
      often lack full metadata, making citation linking hard.
      Semantic Scholar and S2ORC improved this by building large literature graphs.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Dataset</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Data Sampling</h3>
    <p>
      Articles since 2014 under CC-BY 4.0 were sampled equally from 27 disciplines.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Data Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Each article is stored as JSON with metadata, abstract, body text, and references,
      allowing full reconstruction of article hierarchy.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Coverage and Statistics</h3>
    <p>
      The dataset includes 40 000 + documents from 2014–2020 covering medicine,
      engineering, computer science, and other fields.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use of Dataset</h2>
    <p>
      It can be downloaded from 
      <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zm33cdndxs/3" target="_blank">
        Mendeley Data
      </a>
      and supports tasks like citation classification and entity extraction.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      This dataset helps develop and evaluate ML and NLP models for scholarly text
      across disciplines.
    </p>

  <article class="addendum">
    <h2>Addendum – Stylistic Choices</h2>
    <p>
      For this version, I used a strong red background to make the page look bold
      and modern. The text and boxes have light colors to balance the contrast. I
      used “Lato” for body text and “Merriweather” for headings to make it readable
      and elegant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Headings are large and white with a shadow effect. Paragraphs and lists have
      soft backgrounds with rounded corners and a slight glow when hovered over.
      Margins and padding give the page enough space, making it look clean even with
      a red theme. The addendum uses a darker transparent box to separate it from
      the main essay.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML Abuse Fixes</h3>
    <p>
      In Lab 2 I used <h2> for the title; now it’s corrected to <h1>. I also
      separated the essay and addendum using <article> for structure. All design
      changes are done in CSS.
